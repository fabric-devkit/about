# Overview

`Fabric-Devkit` is a collection of projects intended to help people in the following roles gain knowledge about Hyperledger Fabric. The roles are:

* Platform engineers (also known as DevOps) who are involved in creating and/or orchestrating infrastructure and middlewares;

* Application developers who are involved in the creation of User Interfaces (UI) and integrating UI with middleware;

* Product owners are member of an agile team who serves as the Customer proxy responsible for working with Product Management and other stakeholders—including other POs—to define and prioritize stories in the team backlog<sup>[1](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/)</sup>;

Question: If I wanted to learn about why don't I just go to the [official Hyperledger Fabric document][1]?

Firstly, `Fabric-Devkit` is not intended to replace the [official document][1]. It is to complement the [official document][1] or others materials.

Secondly, feedbacks to the maintainers of `Fabric-Devkit` suggested that [official document][1] intended for a "one-size-fits-all" audiance. Hence, the intention of `Fabric Devkit` is to help different personas find learning route that is suited to their needs.

Thirdly, by being independent of the official Hyperledger Fabric projects and practicing the lean startup methodology, it gives the maintainer of the `Fabric-Devkit` the ability to generate Minimum Viable Product (MVP) styled projects where we can quickly gather feedback and then decide to persists or pivot.

## What can I expect from the Fabric Devkit?

The projects under being managed under Fabric Devkit are classified as:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Core | These are projects created without a reference to any specific domains such as Supply Chain, Cryptocurrencies, etc. They are typically projects intending to illustrate the underlying architecture of Hyperledger Fabric or productivity tools that can be used to support other projects. |
| Demo | These are projects created to illustrate one of many ways of implementing a given use case and are domain specific |

## Who are the maintainers?

`Fabric Devkit` projects are based on contributions from volunteers collaborating on an ad hoc basis. 

The two principal contributors (maintainers) are Paul Sitoh and David Carrington, who are also the owner and administrator, respectively, of the Github repositories hosting the `Fabric Devikits`. They will be the final arbiters on the projects to be managed under the banner of `Fabric Devkits`. 

## Can I contribute?

Yes, anyone is welcome to contribute but please abide by the contribution guidelines.
