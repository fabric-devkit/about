# Overview

`Fabric Devkit` is a collection of demonstrator and experimental projects created by Paul Sitoh and David Carrington (i.e. the principal maintainers) to analyse the features and capabilities of Hyperledger Fabric.

## What can I expect from the Fabric Devkit?

You can use the `Fabric Devkit` projects to you learn about Hyperledger Fabric architecture and use cases. However, if I wanted to learn about Hyperledger Fabric, couldn't I just go to the [official Hyperledger Fabric document](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/blockchain.html)?

Firstly, `Fabric-Devkit` is not intended to replace the official document. It is to complement the official document or others materials.

Secondly, feedbacks to the `Fabric-Devkit` maintainers suggest that official document is "one-size-fits-all". If you are new to blockchain it is pretty tough to understand what Hyperledger Fabric is, let alone how to use it. `Fabric DevKit` projects were tailored to satisfy the learning objectives from the point of views of Platform (or DevOps or Site Reliability) Engineers, Application Developers and Product Owners.

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Platform Engineers | Anyone who is responsible for creating or using tools to automate the orchestration of infrastructure and middlewares. |
| Application Developers | Anyone who is involved in the creation of User Interfaces (UI) and integrating UI with middleware. |
| Product owners | Anyone who is member of an agile team who serves as the Customer proxy responsible for working with Product Management and other stakeholders—including other POs—to define and prioritize stories in the team backlog<sup>[1](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/)</sup> |

Thirdly, by being independent of the official Hyperledger Fabric projects it gives the principal maintainers of the `Fabric-Devkit` the ability to share knowledge at a pace of their own choosing.

Fourthly, the best way to learn about a technology is to create and share stuff!

## How can I stuff in Fabric Devkit that interest me?

`Fabric Devkit` projects are categorised as `core`, `dev` or `demo`.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Core | These are projects created without any reference to specific domains such as Supply Chain, Cryptocurrencies, etc. They are typically projects intending to illustrate the underlying architecture of Hyperledger Fabric or productivity tools that can be used to support other projects. |
| Dev | These projects provide basic tools to help developers build applications and also demonstrate principles of developing apps interacting with Hyperledger Fabric|
| Demo | These are projects created to illustrate one of many ways of implementing a given use case. |

Alternatively, you could try to find a `Personas` that matches you and follow the user stories associated with the persona. There are hypertext links that will leead you to aspects of `Fabric Devkit` that might interest you.

## Who maintains the Fabric Devkit?

`Fabric Devkit` projects are based on contributions from volunteers collaborating on an ad hoc basis.

The two principal contributors (maintainers) are Paul Sitoh and David Carrington, who are also the owner and administrator, respectively, of the Github repositories hosting the `Fabric Devikits`. They will be the final arbiters on the projects to be managed under the banner of `Fabric Devkits`.
