# Overview

`Fabric Devkit` is a collection of projects, based on Hyperledger Fabric, created by Paul Sitoh and David Carrington (i.e. the principal maintainers).

The projects started as a way for the principal maintainers to develop deep knowledge about Hyperledger Fabric by translating their knowledge into codes. The principal maintainers also decided to open source `Fabric Devkit` to share knowledge and solicit feedbacks.

## What can I expect from the Fabric Devkit?

The mission of `Fabric Devkit` is to provide Platform (or DevOps or Site Reliability) Engineers, Application Developers and Product Owners with alternative source of knowledge about Hyperledger Fabric.

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Platform Engineers | Anyone who is responsible for creating or using tools to automate the orchestration of infrastructure and middlewares. |
| Application Developers | Anyone who is involved in the creation of User Interfaces (UI) and integrating UI with middleware. |
| Product owners | Anyone who is member of an agile team who serves as the Customer proxy responsible for working with Product Management and other stakeholders—including other POs—to define and prioritize stories in the team backlog<sup>[1](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/)</sup> |

Wait, if I wanted to learn about Hyperledger Fabric, couldn't I just go to the [official Hyperledger Fabric document](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/blockchain.html)?

Firstly, `Fabric-Devkit` is not intended to replace the official document nor claim to represent official positions of Hyperledger Fabric. It is to complement the official document or any other materials about the subject.

Secondly, feedbacks to `Fabric-Devkit` maintainers suggest that official document is "one-size-fits-all". If you are new to blockchain it is pretty tough to understand what Hyperledger Fabric is about and let alone how to use it. Also many of the examples provided by the official documentation mix multiple aspects of the technology together namely, platform engineering and application development. For product owners, who have only worked on traditional applications, the official documentation expects you to have experience working with decentralised system. The intention of `Fabric Devkit` is to help initially the principal maintainers and other collaborators with different backgrounds to find learning route that is suited to their needs.

Thirdly, by being independent of the official Hyperledger Fabric projects and as practitioner of the lean startup methodology, it gives the principal maintainer of the `Fabric-Devkit` the ability to generate Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with minimum bureaucratic processes.

Fourthly, the best way to learn about a technology is to create and share stuff!

## How can I stuff in Fabric Devkit that interest me?

`Fabric Devkit` projects are categorised as either `core` or `demo`.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Core | These are projects created without any reference to specific domains such as Supply Chain, Cryptocurrencies, etc. They are typically projects intending to illustrate the underlying architecture of Hyperledger Fabric or productivity tools. |
| Demo | These are projects created to illustrate one of many ways of implementing a given use case. |

Alternatively, you could try to find a `Personas` that matches you and follow the user stories associated with the persona. There are hypertext links that will leead you to aspects of `Fabric Devkit` that might interest you.

## Who maintains the Fabric Devkit?

`Fabric Devkit` projects are based on contributions from volunteers collaborating on an ad hoc basis.

The two principal contributors (maintainers) are Paul Sitoh and David Carrington, who are also the owner and administrator, respectively, of the Github repositories hosting the `Fabric Devikits`. They will be the final arbiters on the projects to be managed under the banner of `Fabric Devkits`.
